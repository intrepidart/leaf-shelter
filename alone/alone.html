                <div id="part1">please don’t come close to me. i am sick of people trying to help. what’s the point if they don’t understand? i hate their pitiful faces...
                <br />    
                    i want to be alone. 
                </div>

                <div id="part2">i’m sorry, did you not hear me? i don’t believe i stuttered. <br /> stay away! 
                </div>

                <div id="part3">must you go against everything that i say? 
                    what is with that look in your eyes? 
                    i’m exhausted and i want to sit in the dark of my room and think. 
                    i like being left in my thoughts. my thoughts are safe.
                    they are in my control. 
                </div>

                <div id="part4">
                    why are you sitting next to me? 
if you are tired, there is a chair over yonder. 
or better yet, there is a chair in the next room. 
                </div>
        
                <div id="part5">what is it that you are doing with your arms? 
                    why are you spreading them out - is that your way to assert
                    your control over me? over my thoughts? 
                    i feel paralyzed - i can’t move, so please, move away from me. </div>

                <div id="part6">
                    ...huh?
why does this feel so nice. 
i feel like my body is melting, all the built of stress is melting, 
evaporating into bubbles of air..
