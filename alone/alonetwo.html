              <div class="phrase one">
                please don’t come close to me. 
                <br /> 
                i am sick of people trying to help. 
                <br /> 
                what’s the point if they don’t understand? 
                i hate their pitiful faces...
                
                <br /> <br /> 
                i want to be alone. 
              </div>
              
              <div class="phrase two">
                i'm sorry, did you not hear me? <br/>
                i don't believe i stuttered. 
                <br /> 
                stay away! 
              </div>
              
              <div class="phrase three">
                must you go against everything that i say? 
what is with that look in your eyes? 
i’m exhausted and i want to sit in the dark of my room and think. 
i like being left in my thoughts. my thoughts are safe.
they are in my control. 

              </div>

              <div class="phrase four">why are you sitting next to me? 
                if you are tired, there is a chair over yonder. 
                or better yet, there is a chair in the next room. </div>

                <div class="phrase five">what is it that you are doing with your arms? 
                    why are you spreading them out - is that your way to assert
                    your control over me? over my thoughts? 
                    i feel paralyzed - i can’t move, so please, move away from me. </div>

                    <div class="phrase six">...huh?
                        why does this feel so nice. 
                        i feel like my body is melting, all the built of stress is melting, 
                        evaporating into bubbles of air..
                        
                        </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="right">
              <div class="phrase one">
                it’s okay, you can come closer, 
                i would appreciate the company
              </div>
              
              <div class="phrase two">
                don’t be shy, come a little closer. 
              </div>
              
              <div class="phrase three">
                won’t you sit beside me? 
come, there’s something i would like to tell you.  
              </div>
              <div class="phrase four">ah, the feeling of someone next to me..
                it feels nice. comforting, even. </div>

                <div class="phrase five">oh, you are giving me a hug?</div>

                <div class="phrase six">here, let me whisper into your ear. 
                    please don’t be so hard on yourself...
                    don’t push so many people away. 
                    life is too short to be stressed all the time. 
                    
                    there is no promise of tomorrow, the world could be 
                    burning the next day. so, remember to breathe. 
                    remember to feel right now. </div>
