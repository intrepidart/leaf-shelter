            <h3>jan 18. tech rant.</h3>
            <p>- I remember in middle school tech class, we learned the definition of 'technology,' -and I was surprised when I found that it included things we don't think about such as chairs and mechanical pencils. It really is a misused word, and people often say, Oh, the world would be better off without phones and technology, as if that would solve their woes. 
                
                 I interviewed someone the other day, and one of the questions was; if you could wave a magical wand and change anything about the VCU to build community, what would it be? He then answered that VCU would ban all phone usage on campus to force students to communicate with each other. A bit of me also has that wish, although in a less extreme way. It's a known fact that phones have caused us to be disconnected from other people, and therefore, we have all become anxious blobs of meat, avoiding eye contact with others on the street. </p>

            <h3>jan 18. shifting house</h3>
            <p> I used to have a very rigid view on what a website should be, and how it should look like. After having explored more niche websites, I have come to learn that it is okay to think outside of the box, to test the notions and constraints of what a website should look like or how users interact with it. 
                
                 I personally can relate to how websites are rocks thrown in the ocean - people start things in a sudden burst of inspiration, and then suddenly the site is abandoned, leaving people wondering at the things that the website could have turned into. 
                - room - flexible, can shift the contents and links 
                - shelf - small little things to store there
                - plants - can grow and build slowly  
                - puddles - burst, and then evaporate. </p>


            <h3>1.30. handmade web</h3>
            <p>- interesting to note that corporation heavy websites now have people yearning for old, hand-made sites - kind of like how people long for simple, cottagecore life
                -
                - Rothberg has since shared the source code on GitHub, so you too can create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.
                    - I don't think I can do that - make a website by hand only to be destroyed by google's index. definitely a metaphor for something, in the way that .com corporate sites ate away the little handmade webs</p>
