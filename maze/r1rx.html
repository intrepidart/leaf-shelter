                        <br /> <br />
                        you huff. “every pro must make a fluke at least once. besides, i’m taking the scenic route!” 
                        
                        you feel the sweat beading on your forehead, your skin starting to burn already. were you dehydrated already? 
                        <br /> <br />
                        your s.o. takes note, and pulls out your bottle of water from his bag. “okay, but please find a way out before you die from heat stroke. can’t let you go south of heaven too fast.”
                        <br /> <br />
                        “what, so you won’t give me cpr?” you feign a scandalous gasp. “you’ll just stand there in the maze and watch me as i sweat out bullets, lips too chapped to formulate my last words in the form of a clever dad joke?” you scrunch your face in thought.
                        <br /> <br />
                        s.o. “if you come up with a dad joke right here, i will leave you here all alone.”
                        <br /> <br />
                        “ah, you’re so cruel.” 
                        <br /> <br />
                        “cruel is a good color on me.” 
                        <br /> <br />
                        he turns to head back to the direction you come back from, and you amble behind him, still trying to come up with a witty joke.
