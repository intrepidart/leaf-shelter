                    the last time you were in this maze, you were about 10, maybe 9 years old, an unknowing third wheel that had tagged along as the translator. sally and that older white dude that you couldn’t remember. something about watching icarly at the dude’s place. you didn’t like icarly. it brought back unfriendly memories of that daycare in gold’s gym. 
                    <br /><br />
                    the man who greets the two of you is a tall gangly college student with striking red hair and limbs that reminded you of the inflatable tube guy at car dealerships. he’s a strange character, someone that seemed interesting to debate the best ice cream flavors and chocolate with.
                    <br /><br />
                    ‘enjoy~’ he grins, waving the two of you goodbye after he ushers you into the maze. 
                    <br /><br />
                    your s.o. gently nudges your shoulder with his. 
                    <br /><br />
                    “so, lead the way [your name].”
                    <br /><br />
                    you grin. “leave it up to me! we’ll be outta here in no time!” </p></div>
