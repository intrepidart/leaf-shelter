  <h3>alternate universes</h3>
  <div>
    <p class="acco">
   what if. what if. what if. what if i had gone for it? said what i wanted to say? did what i wanted to do? what would it have looked like in an alternate universe where i didn't let fear hold me back?

  <h3>dreams</h3>
  <div>
    <p class="acco">
     i had a dream last night, and the three of them were both there, as if tormenting me, reminding me of their existence, and how i cannot reach them at all. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>indecisions</h3>
  <div>
    <p class="acco">
    i took 30 minutes to order something on a menu. there's too many options in a lifetime, all leading down different paths. sometimes i really wish i had a gut feeling to follow. 
    </p>
     
  </div>

  <h3>past lives</h3>
  <div>
    <p class="acco">
    i've got the strangest feeling..this isn't our first time around. <br /> 
    
    this song has been stuck in my head on repeat, because it plays on the ideas of previous lives. if such a thing were to exist, i think i would like to know the past lives I'd lived, but at the same time, that would overload my headspace even more.
