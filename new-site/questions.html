            Looking back, I've starred a lot of different roles in my dreams. I was an adventurer, a spy, a hero, a love interest, someone with supernatural powers...

            I was <strike>living</strike> <i>dreaming</i> vicariously through each one, having a taste of a life I could never actually have. Occasionally, 
            there would be people I knew that would appear every once in awhile. Then I start thinking again. And the question hits me.

            <details>What role do you think you might have played in other people's dreams? would you like to know?

            Personally, I would want to know how I am in the dreams of others. Was I a sidekick, an NPC, the dreamer's nemesis or love interest or both? What did those dream ami's say? how did they act? did i ever plan world chaos with them? did i fight in wars? survive or die? do people dream of me? yes, i've had people tell me before they have. and honestly? i want to know <i>all</i> of it! 

            I've recorded my fair share of dreams, I had people that I haven't seen or thought of in years appear - why? there are recurring motifs and people. someone i knew from fifth grade, the chipotle manager, mansions, teeth. 
            
            
            Was I someone who appeared that the dreamer hadn't thought of in years and after they wake, do they think 'hm' or do they forget? who else keeps dream journals, and how do they record them?
