            Itâ€™s 2017, and my biggest desire is to be in possession of a device that could record all my dreams, just so i can replay them over and over again without fear of forgetting them. as a past chronic daydreamer , my imaginations often went berserk and wedged themselves into my dreams. Itâ€™s in 2014 when i started jotting them down on stray pages of scrap paper, categorizing them, and itâ€™s in 2015 when i started my first official dream journal. I took great care to organize the table of contents, thought long and hard about how to deliver the story.

            I like to look back on my journals, it reminds me of a time where everything seemed much simpler, and it also makes me smile at the headspace i was in based on the common themes that certain dreams would share.
