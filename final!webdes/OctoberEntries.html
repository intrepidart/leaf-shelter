                        Me and my team were being chased down by the military in their camouflage and snipers. We ended up running to one of our bases and it became a shit show when they showed up all around us. Whenever i shot someone, my teeth would become looser, threatening to fall out. I lost a lot of teeth, but it seemed like i had an excessive amount of teeth.  </p>

                           <p> I am back at the restaurant working. It was super busy, every table was filled, the drink orders piling up as I take them, table by table. So many people without drinks, I was so overwhelmed. </p>

                            Someone had hacked into my discord account, specifically focusing on my leaf shelter server, and exposed it to the whole world. The population went crazy, and i was worried about the things i wrote in there. (mostly just my blurbs, links, and terrible memes shared with H) but people were seeing it as a big deal, and they started making their own channels and threads on my server. I was still in my server, but i wasn’t posting anything, just reading all their negative comments on me, poring through the things i’d posted on there. Then anonymous finds his way in, is able to get my server back, and releases all those mean bullies own dirty secrets. </p>
