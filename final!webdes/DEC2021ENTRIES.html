                        First, I was in those bamboo forests like in the Chinese movies. There was me, an old lady, and a man with long hair dressed in hanfu. (dub thee M for now) Down the path, there was a coffin filled with babies that were alive. I held one in my arms. A strong current of wind magic came, and I tried to hold on to baby but we were teleported to modern day world. Instead of the babies being inside the coffin, it was the old lady. We were constantly skipping between two time periods. We were technically from the past but also have memories of growing up from the future?
                        <br /><br />

                        â€˜My friend invited me to his weddingâ€™ I tell him. â€˜We should go.â€™  <br /><br />
                        So we went. He had changed his attire to pants and cut his hair short. The best friend, letâ€™s call him Tom, is elated. I am wearing one of the bridesmaid dresses, white and golden. I didnâ€™t know all those new people nor the bride. She seemed annoyed that I was there.
                        
                        Then I was seated with everyone as the wedding recital began, dressed back in my old clothes, sitting with M. The wedding was being held in the hall of Tom's elaborate mansion. Later, i explore the bedrooms upstairs. Every one of them was huge and had a bathroom! I got to pick where i stayed at.

                           <p>Dream of grc elevators being broken. C decides to go up the stairs. I wait. Elevator comes and there's L and C. I step in, hesitatant, wary of the elevator condition so at the last moment, I step out. There's a second flight of stairs that I travel up with somebody. On the 7th floor, normality stops. Instead of a next flight of stairs,the show floor is full of man-myth creatures that are working. There's this one that has red devil-shaped wings that shows me how to get to the next floor. It's a very unconventional process. There's these three chimneys in the center of the floor. It was a weird pulley method where there were these ropes hanging from ceiling that we had to wrap around a chimney. And me and some others had to tug.

                            There is someone with bright red bird wings, pastel red skin, dark eyes that were almost black in nature that    helps me get through the floors, the chimney room so red and full of horned creatures and I couldnâ€™t help but be reminded of hell. I get to the tenth floor. The dorms are familiar but suddenly I donâ€™t want to go back being shut in my room. So winged man takes me elsewhere, a little more representative of his realm. Mini volcanoes carve the floors, itâ€™s hot in there. More man-creatures hang out there. He takes me exploring, play some games, talk, as he takes me flying.

	It gets lonely sometimes, farm life. Acres of rolling hills and bustling blue skies with no one to share it with. Itâ€™s okay though. Iâ€™ve come to terms with it. The silence is too familiar of a friend. It creeps in at the oddest of moments, tucked between the cushions of the sofa, penciled in on the songs I hear, the stories I write, and in the half-occupied bed I sleep in. 
	The only company I get is K, the only neighbor for miles around. He would drop by with some extra crops, occasionally inviting me over for dinner.


	I lived in a tiny, boxy, two story house that almost looked like a giant toy. I could touch the ceiling if I tiptoed. 



Had a dream that i had this superpower that allowed me to move and summon and build things at will. I lived in farm area by myself. I had a tiny and boxy two story house and a one seater car with a yellow bear jelly decoration on top of it. One of those days, relatives come over, they plan on going to this place that is 600 miles away. They all get crammed in their cars. I decided to drive my own. I get in bear car, will myself to make a second seat beside mine and make it autopilot. Ultimately I ride alone. I sit back, follow relatives car, but roads were wild, and I had to slow down 5 mph constantly. I decided driving was too much of a hassle so I turned bear jelly into a jet. When Iâ€™m in the air, I realized I didnâ€™t check for a parachute. But I landed okay, in this water park probably in Florida. I really didnâ€™t see why I came.  

Then i am in a gown, heading to a ballroom, except i am constantly on a loop for a while as different women until i find my character and go. I was supposed to be the icon of the show, because they were celebrating my latest achievement. But i play amelie for a bit, as she rushes excitedly to the floor, wonderstruck, as her man goes to dance with her. Once that happens, i am back to myself. And then my heart leaps when i realize 2 things. 1. W was approaching me. 2. I couldnâ€™t dance. I look to the middle aged lady that i had befriended, and she immediately understood. I pause time. Everything is frozen save for me and the old lady. She teaches me a basic, but i am still confused when i unpause the time. W approaches me, offers his hand and a small smile. I accept him, tell him to forgive me if i step on his toes. Then more chaos ensues as soldiers invade the castle. They are after me. I pause time again, grab ushijima by the wrist, and run. My power energy was depleting, so time constantly pause and unpaused. I get him into my getaway bear jelly jet, and just as the soldiers made it outside, we are being lifted off the ground. I take him back to the farm. Castle life really be too much. Farm life was more peaceful after all.

                                I was running out of swipes as i am heading back to the commons. 
                                As i am walking back, i befriend a tall indian girl with groovy curly hair and so we talk, and she  mentions skateboarding and teaching me sometime. We walk back to the dorm . c is already gone for winter break, and i chill a bit with my neighbors. We are all headed to the elevators when they appear, gross and rotting and disgusting. Thereâ€™s not enough room in the elevator for me and i scurry to the stairs before the infected could get me. Iâ€™m able to escape. 
                                <br><br />

                                <br><br />
                                Then iâ€™m flanked by heroes, but i have no power emitting from my hands. They disapprove of me, how could i help them if i had no power to? I had to do this the hard way. I climb from building to building, up and up until i reach a temple high in the clouds atop of this skyscraper. Itâ€™s a buddhist sanctuary, and i go there to pray, to perform a ritual ceremony. The infected slowly inch closer from all directions. I am calm, i see clarity. The only way to escape to to fall out. So i fall, back first, down the sky. As i am falling, i feel a golden warmth ebbing from my hands, a glowing aura growing stronger and stronger. Time seems to slow, i feel confidence flowing through me. A stylized heart glows above where my heart is, and my eyes are golden as i open them. Clarity. I open my eyes just as my magic golden wings unfurl from my back. I dived headfirst to the ground, before swooping forward with a burst of speed, pushing back and eliminating the infected with this golden forcefield. I eliminate most of them in the area, in the city. Only a few more loads to go. But just before i get to it, i fly back up to a different tower, land in front of the avengers with a confident pose and gaze, a silent glare before swooping back down and killing the rest.
