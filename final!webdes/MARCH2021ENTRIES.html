                        At first I headed home to see family, but there's a hurricane warning that night and the roads and homes are flooded. We couldn't go out. Next day, uncle is supposed to come but sis has already bought movie tickets for this 3 hour showing. When we get there, I immediately try to convince her to go back. I had a bad feeling about it but she decides to stay. It's nut a movie. It's like a circle auditorium with a crazy old woman in the center controlling all those people. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        And then I have to break free. It's weird. Because it's like happening in the family garage except the garage is a whole fighting arena. It was me, and these two male swordsman. We were fighting creatures that were made of candy. But if you don't finish all of them off, they will duplicate. It takes a long time to kill them off. When we clear it, there's this yoda goblin shaped thing and in its huge nose are sleeping candy gremljns. I pick them out. Size of toy soccer ball. All of them pour out, and another long fight ensues.
                        By the door, daki and gyu bicker. They are lineart made by candy m+ms. At one point, I have to head back to do schoolwork. When I come back, the sourpatch I thought I had killed had duplicated. Very annoying and long fight.
