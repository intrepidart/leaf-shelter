                        I was chilling with my friend group in one of their houses, as we are talking about the event coming up where couples go dressed up in fancy attire. Emma is doing royal masquerade vibes with fidel, and i decide to go with something simple with my person. Let’s all him Elliot. 

We head to this open field with lots of activities set up - a pool with slides, a game corner, and a gigantic inflatable obstacle course that was so elaborate and difficult to go through. It was so high too! I only went to join lil adventure with this elementary girl who was determined to make it through, and i thought, well, i might as well try also. The first part was already hard, trying to squeeze through a tight maze like course. It got more difficult from there as we have to rock climb up a wall, with dead insects surrounding us. I was so so tempted to use my powers to help make the game easier (saiki powers) so many times i thought that but i was like nah, this normal girl really determined so i’ll suffer through it also.

                            <p>Back at grc. I decide to go out to the gym. It’s gloomy and rainy. I go back in, and then decide to go back out. It’s no longer raining but it is dark. I go to the gym, and then i get lost trying to find grc. (deja vu) i end up going to this tiny station just for lost people. The guy gives me info, and i thank him. I run into tirza and her mother. They walk with me, and i find a shortcut to to grc.
