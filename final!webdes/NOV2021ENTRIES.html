                        Basically I had headquarters in Europe and I was meeting an acquaintance there. Call her MC girl. MC and I had our own infiltration team to get into the government house to break out some of our people. But gov people got the alarm because I had tipped them off. They pursued us, a fight happened, and almost everyone got caught including me. Except I had a breakout plan with this muscular guy and our ppl got off free and then there’s this scene where I’m running down the hall, get to MC’s bar. She looks at me. I look back briefly before going on my way. MC gets out eventually and wants her revenge. So she tracks me down to find that I’m at a HQ in downtown China and ambushes us. It was me and K this time so we have to fend them off. They were tearing up downtown so we didn’t have a choice. K used his powers to stop the invaders. They all exploded due to invisible hands. I flew us to our building and called MC.

                            “You sent your dogs on me. I’ve got a gift coming for you tomorrow.” I say before hanging up. The gifts are the ring fingers of MC’s men. Some of them wear wedding rings.

                            W is the childhood friend who plays pro volleyball. He asks me to come see Japan vs Italy. I go, and we reconnect. I come visit him at one day. I’m sitting at the desk, he’s at the edge of the bed. I’m talking nonchalantly and abruptly he tells me that he misses the old times, where I wasn’t this powerful woman with an army of money and killer henchmen. Back to when we were kids.

                           <p>I think I was orchestrating a good place scenario when secretly it was the bad place? The first part I was just exploring a busy market in China and then I was forced to relocate because people were looking for me. I led this adopted Hispanic kid through the tunnel which opened up to a nice countryside. First come, first serve houses. There were tiny one story trailer houses, a huge mansion, some townhouses, and a multilevel building (think johnson, but luxurious and mold-free). Yeah. we moved in on the second floor. I lead my ‘son’ up the stairs. There was a courtyard in the middle so we can look out at the balcony and windows to see other (very nosy) neighbors. The whole area knew each other, and I believed we all were trying to compete for something huge. Anyways, I lead son to condo, and I run toward the husband. I introduce the son to the husband. Everything is already unpacked and settled in. I let son go to his room to play video games and me and the husband just converse about michael, the person running all of this. Then we notice the neighbor spying on us through the window. I smile at her, before whispering to the husband that we should do the cutesy honeymoon couple act for the meeting later. It had always worked like a charm. Meeting happens, and although everyone acts friendly, none of us really feel that way. We’d have to get rid of the other families somehow. I was just here to avoid the people that were after me when I had helped the son escape from them.

                                Something about school. Me going to high school to attend classes, and instead of walking from place to place, I am flying from place to place. I go on a journey to climb up the mountain to attend this festival with amusement park and performances up in the clouds. I go for awhile, and then i realise it is time to head back down to go to art history. There are everywhere, yet there is no exit. so in the middle of an entire crowd, I start flying with semi-translucent and glittery wings. People start riling up, trying to grab my legs as I start ascending. I shake them off, looking around for the best exit. I end up flying around, and end up landing in a car where B was the crazy driver and he zoomed. There were some other peeps in the back seat, wildin’ about my whole exposing my wings shenanigans and applauding me for it. I am dropped off at the entrance to the mountain. I am carrying my art history notebook as I head back to the school. I see some high schoolers, they approached me, don’t remember the conversation, but it was class-related. I make my way to the classroom, peering through the doors of other classrooms where the teachers were teaching math. I am late.
