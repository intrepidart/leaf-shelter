                        Me and my team were being chased down by the military in their camouflage and snipers. We ended up running to one of our bases and it became a shit show when they showed up all around us. Whenever i shot someone, my teeth would become looser, threatening to fall out. I lost a lot of teeth, but it seemed like i had an excessive amount of teeth.
